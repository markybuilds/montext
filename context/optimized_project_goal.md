# Optimized Project Goal

Design and document a Montext context system upgrade that adopts the "Code Execution with MCP" pattern from Anthropic's engineering guidance so that Montext agents can reason about, plan, and execute repository tasks through a first-class MCP code-execution server. The context should encode how MCP tooling, sandbox lifecycle management, and log/telemetry capture integrate with Montext's atomic context operations.
