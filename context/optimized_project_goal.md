# Optimized Project Goal

Demonstrate Codex-driven automation for the Montext autonomous system by showing a fully-initialized context, executable workflows, and clear guidance so that Codex agents can bootstrap, plan, and execute tasks inside this repository without additional human input.

## Success Criteria
- Context files (`optimized_project_goal.md`, `inbounds.md`, `outerbounds.md`, `tasks.md`) exist with current, actionable content.
- Montext Codex automation scripts and instructions are validated so a Codex agent can run `scripts/montext-codex.sh --goal "..."` without guesswork, including prerequisites, dry-run expectations, and logging touchpoints.
- Demonstration tasks highlight how Codex agents should analyze, plan, execute, and log progress using the context loop, with each task tied to a measurable output (docs updated, scripts verified, logs captured, etc.).
- Repository state documents how Codex automation fits into the workflow (README quickstart, system documentation references, execution logs) so future Codex runs can continue from this checkpoint with minimal manual intervention.
